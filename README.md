trapsim-notebooks
=================

This set of notebooks, ROOT scripts, and shell scripts constitute
something of a stack for doing simulations and analysis of surface
electrode traps. A few ROOT scripts take a `.dxf` trap layout file and
run BemSolver on them to get the potential contribution of each
electrode. Then use the notebooks to visualize potentials, fit
electrodes to a target potential, and find equilibrium positions.
